    <h3> Introduction and Description </h3> 
    <p> Project 1 is a project focused on learning how to develop shiny app web applications for data manipulation and visualization. Some of the basic things covered within this app is learning how to import data, manipulate said data and then create a user interface for visualizing the data. </p> 
    
   <br> 
    
   <p>  The project focuses on visualizing the energy that is used within the US and looking at the data over time. There is a focus on 9 resources overall: Coal, Hydro, Natural Gas, Petroleum, Wind,                           Wood, Nuclear, Geothermal, and Solar. </p> 
   
   <br> 
   
   <p> The first page displays the totals for the US and shows the 9 energies over time. The energy sources can be selected to give a more comprehensive idea. </p>

   <p> The second page allows the user to interact with two different regions and they are allowed to choose energy sources to compare between. They are able to select the same location and compare the same source over time or different sources in the same time frame for instance. The user is also able to select two different energy sources, two different time periods, and two different locations for comparison. The data displayed shows box plots for change in time as well as contribution. There are line plots for growth over time and raw data for comparison as well. </p> 
   <br>

   <br> 
   <p> Finally the user is allowed to compare two different energy sources and two different time periods looking at the US holistically.   </p>

  <p> There is an about page on the fourth tab. </p>
